Python Library for integrating with Smartex
-------------------------------------

This library is compatible with Python 2.7.8. It is not compatible with Python 3.

This library is a simple way to integrate your application with
Smartex for taking ethereum payments. It exposes three basic
functions, authenticating with smartex, creating invoices,
and retrieving invoices. It is not meant as a replacement for
the entire Smartex API. However, the key_utils module contains
all of the tools you need to use the Smartex API for other
purposes.
